### **Introduction**

The project goal is to create a backend Symfony application that will 
provide possibility to track and manage currency exchange rates.

Application provides tools for:
- Persisting exchange rates between currency pairs (e.g. USD -> EUR).
- Storing historical exchange rate data.
- Managing tracked currency pairs via console commands.
- Updating exchange rates automatically every minute.
- Exposing a JSON API to retrieve exchange rate information (based on stored data) with date-time precision.

Application is integrated with a free third-party API: **FreeCurrencyAPI** (https://freecurrencyapi.com/).

### 1. How to set up a project
1. Install `Docker` (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Clone repository
    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:CvetkovsAntons/currency-exchange-tracker.git
    cd currency-exchange-tracker
    ```
3. Clone `.env.sample` to `.env`
    ```shell
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```
4. Configure environment variables in `.env` file. `CURRENCY_API_KEY` is required
    ```.dotenv
    CURRENCY_API_KEY=your_currency_api_key_here
    ```
5. Run docker compose
   - Using Make (recommended):
       ```shell
       make start
       ```
   - Without Make:
       ```shell
       docker compose up -d
       ```
6. Check if the app is running at http://localhost:8080/health-check

### 2. **Available commands**

## **Important**
It is recommended to run all commands from inside the container!

But, if you want to be able to run them outside the container, 
then you'll need to change database URL inside the `.env` file:
- From:
    ```dotenv
    DATABASE_URL="pgsql://${DATABASE_USER}:${DATABASE_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/${DATABASE}?serverVersion=16&charset=utf8"
    ```
- To:
    ```dotenv
    DATABASE_URL="pgsql://${DATABASE_USER}:${DATABASE_PASSWORD}@127.0.0.1:5432/${DATABASE}?serverVersion=16&charset=utf8"
    ```

### 4. **API usage example**

## GET: `/health-check`
### Description
Returns a simple status response to confirm that the application is running and able to serve requests.

### Example call
```shell
  curl "localhost:8080/health-check"
```
### Example response
```json
{
    "status": "ok"
}
```

## GET: `/exchange-rate`
### Description
Returns the most recent exchange rate saved in the database for the specified currency pair closest to the given date.

### Query parameters
- `from`: Source currency code (e.g. USD)
- `to`: Target currency code (e.g. EUR)
- `datetime`: Optional ISO 8601 datetime for historical rate (e.g. 2025-06-30 12:00:00)

### Example call
```shell
  curl "localhost:8080/exchange-rate?from=EUR&to=USD&datetime=2025-06-30 12:00:00"
```
### Example response
```json
{
    "from": "EUR",
    "to": "USD",
    "rate": "1.1729653007",
    "datetime": "2025-06-30 12:00:00"
}
```

### 5. **Running tests**
All tests use a separate test database (`--env=test`). This ensures production data is not affected.

To run tests:
- Using Make (recommended):
    ```shell
    make app-tests-run
    ```
- Without Make:
    ```shell
    docker exec -it currency-exchange-app php bin/phpunit
    ```

### 6. **Troubleshooting / FAQ**

Anticipate common issues, such as:

- **Vendor folder is empty in container but not on host:**  
  Make sure you install Composer dependencies _inside the container_ or mount them correctly.

- **Worker not starting after `stop` command:**  
  Run `docker compose up -d worker` to restart the worker container.

- **Database errors on startup:**  
  Ensure `.env` is properly configured and PostgreSQL is accessible at `postgres:5432`.
